# Dissertation-Emotion-Detection-In-Text

Bachelor Thesis of Andrianos Michail named Emotion Detection in Text using my own code to apply Traditional NLP Preprocessing, Features and Classifications systems.

Includes code in Python files, HTML Documentation and Report in PDF Format.

The challenge in this thesis included building everything from scratch: Vectorizers, Preprocessing, Feed Forward Neuralnetworks and everything there was necessary to build an NLP Classification system.

Thus, the code is long and built into one file to accomodate time restrictions. The imports were limited to the absolutely necessary ones and building this code was a great challenge by itself.
